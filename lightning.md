# Call for Lightning Talks

**Do you have an idea about consistency which you would like to share with the distributed systems community?** Maybe a controversial opinion about distributed data you would like to argue? How about an open-source distributed system you would like to promote or some practical wisdom to impart about data consistency in the wild? If the answer to any of these questions is yes, then lightning talks at PoPoC 2021 are for you!

Since its inception in 2014, the PaPoC workshop series has brought together researchers and practitioners who seek to develop a better understanding of consistency in distributed systems. PaPoC 2021 will be held virtually on April 26th, and for the first time, will include lightning talks to enable more members of the community to participate in PaPoC and thus help researchers and practitioners to connect with one another and find collaborators. 

The PaPoC workshop invites submissions of lightning talks via the short form below.  Lightning talks will be up to 3 mins each and must use only one slide. The deadline for submissions is **April 16th, 2021 23:59 hrs [AoE](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe)**. In case of any questions, please contact the Program Chairs at [papoc21@easychair.org](mailto:papoc2021@easychair.org).
